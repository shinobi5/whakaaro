        <h1>What is data sovereignty?</h1>

        <p>  
          I got into martial arts at a young age through Taekwondo and around 2006 I started training in Brazilian jiu jitsu. On a daily basis I develop software and build user interface components but I also play around with hardware and tinker with computers and electronics.

          The first thing that springs to mind is the importance of managing complexity. Coming up with solutions to complex problems inevitably comes down to identifying patterns and breaking the problem down into manageable and understandable components.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In a similar manner you can break martial arts down into smaller components. These fundamental components can be combined to solve complex problems.

          Jiu jitsu in practice is a form of chess. It requires strategy and tactics executed in a live and free flowing environment. Making decisions and solving multiple problems on the go in a high pressure situation can be complex. But if you're able to understand the underlying concepts the complexity can be managed.
        <p>

        <p>
          Developing the ability to manage complexity against skilled opponents requires knowledge of core concepts like weight distribution, balance, pressure, space, and leverage. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          One way to gain this knowledge is through repetition of techniques focused on particular positions/scenarios and pressure testing these techniques through live sparring.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Can you show me that technique you used?" This is a common question I've been asked after a roll (a round of sparring). It's often not a specific, codified, technique. It's usually an opportunity that presents itself in the moment based on an understanding of core concepts.

          An example might be that a training partner has only one of their arms on the ground supporting their weight (because the other arm is tied up in some other problem I'm posing for them). I notice they're leaning a lot of weight on that arm and so I sweep it away. The result is they fall to that side because there's nothing else there to support them.  They're also not distributing their weight with a focus on maintaining balance if that arm is removed as a support structure.

          A simple solution based on simple physics. What happens if you cut off one leg of a dining room table? It'll probably fall over. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Focus on the complex whole and it's hard to see the smaller problems that require simple solutions.
