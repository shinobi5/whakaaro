        <h1>He aha?</h1>

        <p>
          Ko tēnei taku wāhi i te ipurangi hei ako, hei tūhura, hei kōrero mō ngā kaupapa e rata ana ki ahau — pēnei i te hangarau me te pūkaha o ēnei rā, me ngā take e pā ana ki te tangata whenua o Aotearoa.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my corner of the web to learn, explore, and write about topics that interest me — including modern technology and engineering, and issues relating to the indigineous people of Aotearoa New Zealand.
          In the process I want to explore ways Māori can utilise digital tools to support Māori development and tino rangatiratanga aspirations.
        </p>

        <h2>Ko wai ahau?</h2>

        <p>
          He uri ahau nō Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Porou. 
          Nō Rotorua ahau.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm a descendant of the Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue and Ngāti Porou peoples and I'm from Rotorua in Aotearoa New Zealand.
          I spent some time in Tauranga and Wellington before returning home around 6 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>          
          I don't have any social media accounts and I like to keep a low-profile. 
          I don't really like attention and I value privacy. 
        </p>

        <p>
          So why write a public blog?
        </p>

        <p>
          The main reason is to organise and record my thoughts. 
          I could write offline but I figure someone else may find the whakaaro interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>Kaihanga Pūmanawa Rorohiko</h2>

        <p>
          I've been a web developer for the past 14 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm drawn to working on the web platform due to the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">open web principles</a>.
          Currently the web is largely divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gardens</a> that are controlled and monetised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> companies.
          In addition to big tech control, some governments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship">exert control</a> over citizen access to the internet and the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of the current state, I still believe in the web as an important public and open resource for all.
          I'm an advocate for the open web and it's my platform of choice to design and build on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general I'm a problem solver and tinkerer and I've always been curious about how things work and how parts of a system (including sub-systems) relate and connect.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Tino rangatiratanga
        </h2>

        <p>
          Mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_rangatiratanga">tino rangatiratanga</a> to some peope in New Zealand and you risk triggering irrational beliefs and fear.
          As if the term means Māori intend to stage a take-over of the New Zealand government and society.
        </p>

        <p>
          How exactly would we do this? With our strength in numbers?
        </p>

        <p>
          When I use the term I'm simply referring to self-determination. 
          The desire (and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/indigenous-peoples/about-indigenous-peoples-and-human-rights">human right</a>) to decide on what's best for our people, our culture and our future.
          I'm not referring to a position of power over others.
          In my eyes, it has nothing to do with power dynamics.
          It's simply the right to make decisions over our own well being.
        </p>

        <p>
          Is it really such a terrible thing that we want to have some control over our future?
          That we value the knowledge and wisdom passed down from our ancestors?
          That we believe in the beauty of our language, arts and crafts?
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's say the roles are reversed. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Would I have a problem with the English language being supported throughout our education system?
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course not.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wouldn't even cross my mind to have a problem with a minority group in New Zealand celebrating and valuing their language, heritage and culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          So hopefully it is now clear what I mean when I refer to tino rangatiratanga in the future.
          There's no need for it to be a confronting term.       
        </p>

        <h2>E Tipu E Rea</h2>
        
        <p>
          The following whakatauki (proverb) was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80pirana_Ngata">Apirana Ngata</a> in 1949 in the autograph book of a school student:
        </p>
        
        <figure>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              E tipu, 
              e rea, 
              mo nga ra o tou ao, 
              ko to ringa ki nga rakau a te Pakeha hei ora mo te tinana, 
              ko to ngakau ki nga taonga a o tipuna Maori hei tikitiki mo to mahuna, 
              a ko to wairua ki to Atua, nana nei nga mea katoa.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

        <p>
          Translation:<br/>
          Thrive in the days destined for you, 
          your hand to the tools of the Pākehā to provide physical sustenance,
          your heart to the treasures of your ancestors to adorn your head, 
          your soul to the creator to whom all things belong.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whakatauki illustrates the dynamic, adaptable, and practical nature of Māori.
        </p>

        <p>
          Digital technology offers a range of tools we can utilise to adapt to modern times.
          Tools we can use to tautoko our aspirations while applying the knowledge of our tīpuna to guide our hands in the use of these tools.
