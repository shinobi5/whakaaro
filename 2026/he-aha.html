        <h1>He aha?</h1>

        <p>
          Ko tēnei taku wāhi i te ipurangi hei ako, hei tūhura, hei kōrero mō ngā kaupapa e rata ana ki ahau — pēnei i te hangarau me te pūkaha o ēnei rā, me ngā take e pā ana ki te tangata whenua o Aotearoa.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my corner of the web to learn, explore, and talk about topics that interest me — including modern technology and engineering, and issues relating to the indigineous people of Aotearoa New Zealand.
          In the process I want to explore ways Māori can use digital technology to gain more control over current and future aspirations.
          Te tino rangatiratanga o mātou taonga. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ko wai ahau?</h2>

        <p>
          He uri ahau nō Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Porou. 
          Nō Rotorua ahau.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm a descendant of the Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue and Ngāti Porou peoples and I'm from Rotorua in Aotearoa New Zealand.
          I spent some time in Tauranga and Wellington before returning home around 6 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>          
          I don't have any social media accounts and I like to keep a low-profile. 
          I don't really like attention and I value privacy. 
        </p>

        <p>
          So why write a public blog?
        </p>

        <p>
          The main reason is to organise and record my thoughts. 
          I could write offline but I figure someone else may find the whakaaro interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>Kaihanga Pūmanawa Rorohiko</h2>

        <p>
          I've been a professional web developer for the past 14 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm drawn to working on the web platform because of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">open web principles</a>.
          Currently the web is largely divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gardens</a> that are controlled and monetised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> companies.
          In addition to big tech control, some governments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship">exert control</a> over citizen access to the internet and the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of the current state, I still believe in the web as an important public and open resource for all.
          I'm an advocate for open information and tools and the web is my platform of choice to design and build on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general I'm a problem solver and tinkerer and I've always been curious about how things work and how parts of a system (including sub-systems) relate and connect.
          I also like learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_engineering">automotive engineering</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">embedded systems</a>, and restoring and working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)">E30's</a>.

        <h2>
          Te ao Māori
        </h2> 

        <p>
          Te ao Māori is the holistic worldview of the Māori people. It's a framework through which we understand and interact with the world around us.
        </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Te ao Māori (literally 'the Māori world') is a phrase often used to indicate the knowledge, understandings, and practices that have arisen from the distinct and Indigenous cultural context of Aotearoa New Zealand.

            <p>
              Te ao Māori emphasises the importance of relationships between nature and people. 
              It is a holistic worldview that focuses on interconnections and is grounded in tikanga customary values and lore and mātauranga knowledge. 
              Practices, values and principles from te ao Māori have been developed around marae to bring ancestors and communities together in one place in deep connection with whenua and taiao environment

        <p>
          Due to the effects of colonisation on Māori people it's hard to pinpoint a central world view or set of practices. 
          Today it's a spectrum with some Māori having no knowledge of the culture to those that have a deep understanding of it. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Exploring the impacts of colonisation and assimilation on our people will likely be a post for another day. 
          For now it's important to point out the current reality.

        <p>
          Translation:<br/>
          Grow up tender child in the days of your world,<br/>
          In your hands the tools of the Pākehā,<br/> 
          As means to support and sustain you.<br/> 
          In your heart the treasures of your ancestors,<br/>
          As a plume for your head.<br/>
          Your spirit to the Creator,<br/> 
          The source of all things.<br/> 
        </p>

        <p>
          These words from Āpirana Ngata demostrate the willingness to adapt our ways and adopt new tools while continuing to look to the wisdom and knowledge of our ancestors to guide us mentally and spiritually.
        </p>

        <p>
          Māori culture is adaptable and dynamic. 
          It's not set in time and there are many examples, in the past and present, that demonstrate a willingness to adopt new tools, beliefs and practices.
          Although dynamic there are still core practices and beliefs that will always remain unchanged. Whakapapa and our connection with te taio (the natural world) are at the core of our knowledge and belief systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Digital technology offers a range of tools we can use to support the social, cultural and economic aspirations of Māori.
          AI tools can have negative effects on our people if we don't understand how it works. There is a real risk of further marginalisation of our culture and people in New Zealand society (and the world). 
          These are are some of the topics I'll be exploring in future posts.
