        <h1>He aha?</h1>

        <p>
          Ko tēnei taku wāhi i te ipurangi hei ako, hei tūhura, hei kōrero mō ngā kaupapa e rata ana ki ahau — pēnei i te hangarau me te pūkaha o ēnei rā, me ngā take e pā ana ki te tangata whenua o Aotearoa.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my corner of the web to learn, explore, and talk about topics that interest me — including modern technology and engineering, and issues relating to the indigineous people of Aotearoa New Zealand.
          In the process I want to explore ways Māori can use digital technology to gain more control over current and future aspirations.
          Te tino rangatiratanga o mātou taonga. 
        </p>

        <h2>Ko wai ahau?</h2>

        <p>
          He uri ahau nō Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Porou. 
          Nō Rotorua ahau.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm a descendant of the Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue and Ngāti Porou peoples and I'm from Rotorua in Aotearoa New Zealand.
          I spent some time in Tauranga and Wellington before returning home around 6 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>          
          I don't have any social media accounts and I like to keep a low-profile. 
          I don't really like attention and I value privacy. 
        </p>

        <p>
          So why write a public blog?
        </p>

        <p>
          The main reason is to organise and record my thoughts. 
          I could write offline but I figure someone else may find the whakaaro interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>Kaihanga Pūmanawa Rorohiko</h2>

        <p>
          I've been a professional web developer for the past 14 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm drawn to working on the web platform because of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">open web principles</a>.
          Currently the web is largely divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gardens</a> that are controlled and monetised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> companies.
          In addition to big tech control, some governments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship">exert control</a> over citizen access to the internet and the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of the current state, I still believe in the web as an important public and open resource for all.
          I'm an advocate for open information and tools and the web is my platform of choice to design and build on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general I'm a problem solver and tinkerer and I've always been curious about how things work and how parts of a system (including sub-systems) relate and connect.
          I also like learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_engineering">automotive engineering</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">embedded systems</a>, and restoring and working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)">E30's</a>.

        <h2>
          Te ao Māori
        </h2> 

        <p>
          Te ao Māori is the way we view and interact with the people and world around us and our place in te taiao (the natural world).

            <p>
              Te ao Māori (literally 'the Māori world') is a phrase often used to indicate the knowledge, understandings, and practices that have arisen from the distinct and Indigenous cultural context of Aotearoa New Zealand.

            <p>
              Te ao Māori emphasises the importance of relationships between nature and people. 
              It is a holistic worldview that focuses on interconnections and is grounded in tikanga customary values and lore and mātauranga knowledge. 
              Practices, values and principles from te ao Māori have been developed around marae to bring ancestors and communities together in one place in deep connection with whenua and taiao environment

          Due to the effects of colonisation on Māori people it's hard to pinpoint a central world view or set of practices today.

          Translation:
          Grow up tender child in the days of your world, 
          In your hands the tools of the Pākehā, 
          As means to support and sustain you. 
          In your heart the treasures of your ancestors,
          As a plume for your head.
          Your spirit given to God, 
          The source of all things.
