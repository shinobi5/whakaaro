        <h1>He aha?</h1>

        <p>
          Ko tēnei taku wāhi i te ipurangi hei ako, hei tūhura, hei kōrero mō ngā kaupapa e rata ana ki ahau — pēnei i te hangarau me te pūkaha o ēnei rā, te ao Māori, me ngā take e pā ana ki te whanaketanga ōhanga-pāpori o te tangata whenua.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is my corner of the web to learn, explore, and talk about topics that interest me — including modern technology and engineering, the Māori world, and issues related to Māori socio-economic development.
          In the process I want to explore ways Māori can use digital technology to gain more control over our current and future aspirations: Tino rangatiratanga through digital tools.
        </p>

        <h2>Ko wai ahau?</h2>

        <p>
          He uri ahau nō Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Porou. 
          Nō Rotorua ahau.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm a descendant of the Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue and Ngāti Porou peoples and I'm from Rotorua in Aotearoa/New Zealand.
          I spent some time in Tauranga and Wellington before returning home around 6 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>          
          I don't have any social media accounts and I like to keep a low-profile. 
          I don't really like attention and I value privacy. 
        </p>

        <p>
          So why write a public blog?
        </p>

        <p>
          The main reason is to organise and record my thoughts. 
          I could write offline but I figure someone else may find the whakaaro helpful or interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly this is a place where I can extract and unravel my thoughts on topics that are either important and/or interesting to me. 
          It gives me a medium where I can bring order and clarity to my thoughts on modern technology, te ao Māori and Māori development. 
          A set of documents I can access anywhere in the world on any device capable of running a web browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Kaihanga Pūmanawa Rorohiko</h2>

        <p>
          I've been a professional web developer for the past 14 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm drawn to working on the web platform because of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">open web principles</a>.
          In reality the web is largely divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform">walled gardens</a> that are controlled and monetised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">big tech</a> companies.
          In addition to big tech control, some governments <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship">exert control</a> over citizen access to the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of the current state, I still believe in it as an important public and open resource for all.
          I'm an open web advocate and the web is my platform of choice to design and build on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general I'm a problem solver and tinkerer and I've always been curious about how things work and how parts of a system (including sub-systems) relate and connect.
          I'm also interested in automotive engineering and embedded systems and I like restoring and working on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)">E30's</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the reasons I enjoy working with computer tech is because I know I'll never be able to master it. 
          Software development alone covers a range of specialty areas you can dedicate a lifetime to.
          The learning process is never ending and I just find computer systems interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Te ao Māori
        </h2> 
        <p>
          Te ao Māori is the way we see the world and live with it.
          It includes our connection to te taiao (the natural world).
          It is not just a time warp to the times before Pākehā arrived in Aotearoa.
          Te ao Māori and kaupapa Māori is central to how we want to live in current times.
        </p>

          <p>
            Te ao Māori (literally 'the Māori world') is a phrase often used to indicate the knowledge, understandings, and practices that have arisen from the distinct and Indigenous cultural context of Aotearoa New Zealand.

        <p>
          I should first clarify that not all Māori people would say that they want to view the world around them in this way.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ta Moko and the move to metal tools is an example of our willingness to adopt and adapt different tools for practical reasons. 
          There are many examples of using western scientific methods after contact with Pākehā people.

          Grow up O tender child in the days of your world, 
          In your hands the tools of the Pākehā, 
          As means to support and sustain you. 
          In your heart the treasures of your ancestors,
          As a plume for your head.
          Your spirit given to God, 
          The source of all things.
