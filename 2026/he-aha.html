        <h1>He aha?</h1>

        <p>
          He wāhi tēnei mō ngā kōrero e pā ana ki te hangarau, te pūkaha, me te ao Māori.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a place for kōrero on technology, engineering, and the Māori world.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is my corner of the web to learn and explore topics of interest to me that relate to modern technology, engineering practices and te ao Māori. 
          In the process I want to explore how tangata whenua can benefit from current and emerging technology through kaupapa Māori.
        </p>

        <h2>Ko wai ahau?</h2>

        <p>
          He uri ahau nō Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue, Ngāti Porou. 
          Nō Rotorua ahau.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I'm a descendant of the Ngāti Pikiao, Ngāti Whakaue and Ngāti Porou people and I'm from Rotorua.
          I spent some time in Tauranga and Wellington before returning to Rotorua around 6 years ago.
        </p>

        <p>          
          I don't have any social media accounts. 
          I keep a low-profile in general. 
          I don't really like attention and I value privacy. 
          I'm not keen to have my life on display for strangers.
        </p>

        <p>
          So why write a public blog?
        </p>

        <p>
          The main reason is to organise and record my thoughts. 
          I could create an offline document (even a notebook) but I figure someone else may find the whakaaro helpful or interesting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most importantly this blog is a place where I can extract and unravel my thoughts on topics that are either important and/or interesting to me. 
          It gives me a medium where I can bring order and clarity to my thoughts on modern technology and te ao Māori. 
          A set of documents I can access anywhere in the world on any device capable of running a web browser.
        </p>

        <h2>Kaihanga Pūmanawa Rorohiko</h2>

        <p>
          I've been working as a web developer for the past 14 years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm drawn to working on the web platform due to the open web principles and philosophy.
          These days the web is largely divided into "walled gardens" that are controlled and monetised by big tech companies.
          In addition to big tech control, some governments exert control over citizen access to the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of the current situation on the web, I still believe in it as a decentralised, public and open resource for all.
          I'm an open web advocate and the web is my platform of choice to design and build on.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general I'm a problem solver and tinkerer and I've always been curious about how things work and how parts of a system (including sub-systems) relate and connect.
          I'm also interested in automotive engineering and embedded systems and I like restoring and working on cars from the 80's and 90's.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of the reasons I enjoy working with computer tech is because I know I'll never be able to master it in my lifetime. 
          Software development alone covers a range of specialty areas you can dedicate a lifetime to.
          The learning process is never ending and I just find computers fascinating.
